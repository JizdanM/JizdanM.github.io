<br>

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm just a guy trying to code. My name is Mihai 
or Michael, you can call me whatever lies better on your tongue. I'm 
living in Moldova, burning my life.

<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At the moment I am at the 4th year at the 
"CEITI" college, studying programming. For the time being I'm building 
this site

<center><h2>What are my plans?</h2></center>

<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For my future I'm planning to work in IT 
so I like to study different subjects like AI and low-level programming. 
OS is also a subject I find interesting, however it's not my primary focus. 
As a side plan I want to try learning more about AI as well as creating a 
fully working, self-teachable AI model similar to J.A.R.V.I.S from the 
movie "Iron Man"
