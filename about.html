<center><h2>Who am I?</h2></center>

<p>
    I'm just an amateur programmer and software developer. I have strong analytical 
    capabilities and solving skills as well as critical thinking and stress resistant. For
    now I am just a junior and searching for oportunities to get more experience in the
    software developing scene.</p>

<center><h2>What are my plans?</h2></center>

<p> 
    For now I'm just searching for some work experience as well as more knowledge
    about the software developing world. I'm interested in learning more about
    app development, OS, AI, software engineering and other related topics. I'm also interested in learning
    more about the business side of the software developing world - how companies work,
    what is the process of building a large scale app etc.
