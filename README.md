## Curriculum Vitae idea

I had to make a CV, yet the original style of a CV seemed boring to me, so I decided to make my CV in a coder style - making a site.

This is the code for my site that reprezents a CV about me.

Main style was chosen to be of the old black/green terminals. The information for CV being split to different documents and being shown after writing a specific command in a command line. For accesibility it was decided to add buttons for different categories and using javascript to emulate text typing for the specific category command.

Maybe one day I will update this
